## Highlights

### Russian Language Support 🇷🇺

OpenTranscribe now supports **8 UI languages** with the addition of Russian (Русский). The complete translation covers all 1,600+ strings in the application, making it fully accessible to Russian-speaking users.

Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, and now Russian.

### Protected Media Authentication

A new plugin-based system enables downloading media from password-protected corporate video portals:

- **MediaCMS Provider** - Built-in support for [MediaCMS](https://mediacms.io/) installations
- **Extensible Architecture** - Plugin system allows adding support for other authenticated media sources
- **Secure Credentials** - Username/password sent securely, never stored in database
- **Smart UI** - Auth fields appear automatically when entering URLs from configured hosts

To enable, add your MediaCMS hosts to `.env`:
```bash
MEDIACMS_ALLOWED_HOSTS=media.example.com,mediacms.internal
```

### Bug Fixes

- **VRAM Monitoring** - Fixed KeyError on non-CUDA devices when logging GPU stats
- **Loading Screen** - Fixed raw translation key appearing during initial page load
- **URL Handling** - Centralized URL construction for consistent behavior across dev/production

## How to Update

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

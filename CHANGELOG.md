## [0.3.3] - 2025-01-13

### Overview
Community contributions release featuring Russian language support, protected media authentication for corporate video portals, and various bug fixes and improvements.

Special thanks to [@vfilon](https://github.com/vfilon) for contributing all four PRs in this release!

### Added

#### Internationalization
- **Russian Language Support** - Added Russian (Русский) as the 8th supported UI language (#114)
- **Protected Media Translations** - Added translations for protected media feature to all 7 non-English languages

#### Protected Media Authentication (#115)
- **Plugin Architecture** - New extensible plugin system for authenticated media downloads from corporate/internal video portals
- **MediaCMS Provider** - Built-in support for MediaCMS installations requiring authentication
- **Frontend UI** - Username/password fields appear automatically when entering URLs from configured protected media hosts
- **Security** - Credentials are transmitted securely and never stored in the database

#### URL Utilities (#116)
- **Centralized URL Construction** - New `getFlowerUrl()`, `getAppBaseUrl()`, and `getVideoUrl()` utilities for consistent URL handling across dev and production environments

### Fixed

- **VRAM Monitoring** - Added validation for VRAM monitoring keys to prevent KeyError on non-CUDA devices (#113)
- **Loading Screen** - Fixed "app.loadingApplication" raw key displaying during initial page load by using hardcoded text before i18n initializes

### Changed

- **Flower Dashboard** - Refactored URL construction to use centralized utility function
- **Video Playback** - Updated video URL construction to work correctly behind nginx reverse proxy

### Upgrade Notes

Standard Docker Compose update:
```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## [0.3.2] - 2025-12-17

### Overview
Patch release fixing critical bugs in the one-liner installation script that prevented successful setup on fresh installations.

**Note:** This is a scripts-only release. No Docker container rebuild required.

### Fixed

#### Setup Script Fixes
- **Scripts Directory Creation** - Fixed curl error 23 ("Failure writing output to destination") when downloading SSL and permission scripts by creating the `scripts/` directory before download attempts
- **PyTorch 2.6+ Compatibility** - Applied `torch.load` patch to `download-models.py` for PyTorch 2.6+ compatibility, mirroring the fix already present in the backend (from Wes Brown's commit 8929cd6)
  - PyTorch 2.6 changed `weights_only` default to `True`, causing omegaconf deserialization errors during model downloads
  - The patch sets `weights_only=False` for trusted HuggingFace models

### Upgrade Notes

For existing installations, no action required - Docker containers already have the PyTorch fix.

For new installations, the one-liner setup script will now work correctly:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/master/setup-opentranscribe.sh | bash
```
